- Google Direction API
- Google Geolocation API

## Implementation Timeline
- Day 1: Set up APIs and get familiar with usage and documentation. Create basic architecture for the app. 
- Day 2: Write algorithm that will calculate the best routes. Graph traversal with weighted edges.
- Day 3: Have the map and algorithm working together
- Day 4: Work on frontend, have all nessary displays
- Day 5: Polish up front end, make sure all features work as intended
- Day 6-7: Bug fixes, account for any extra days for unexpected obstacles. 

## Bonus features
